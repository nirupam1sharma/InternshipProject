Philosophy considers the answers offered by science, religion, and common sense and tries to push further. If science tells us important truths about cause and effect, philosophy asks: what is it to cause something? If religion tells us to be good, philosophy asks: which acts are good, and why do they count as being good? If common sense says that everything is just a matter of opinion, philosophy asks: is that itself just a matter of opinion, or is it objectively true? This course isa general introduction to philosophy, focusing on some of the most powerful, influential, and surprising arguments philosophers have put forwardover the centuries.
